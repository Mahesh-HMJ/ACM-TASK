# ACM-TASK
I HAD IMPLEMENTED THE FIRST GALLERY PAGE FROM THE TWO SAMPLE GALLERY PAGES YOU HAD PROVIDED.
I TRIED MY LEVEL BEST TO CLONE THE GALLERY PAGE 1.
I MAKE THE PAGE INTO THREE SECTIONS, FIRST ONE IS NAV, SECOND ONE IS CONTENT AND THE THIRD ONE IS FOOTER.
I HAD INCLUDED ALL THE THINGS WHICH ARE PRESENT IN THE FIGMA FILE IN THE NAV BAR.
COMING TO THE CONTENT I HAD USED THE SAME PICTURES WHICH ARE GIVEN IN THE FIGMA FILE IN MY PROJECT.
AT LAST THE FOOTER ALSO CONTAINS ALL THE COMPONENTS WHICH ARE THERE IN THE SAMPLE PAGE.
I CAN'T ABLE TO MATCH THE COLOURS IN THE FIGMA FILE, SO I USED ALMOST SIMILAR COLORS TO THE FIGMA FILE IN MY WEBPAGE.
*** THANK YOU ***
